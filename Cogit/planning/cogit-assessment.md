# Cogit Assessment

## Overview
This document outlines the assessment and planning for the Cogit project refactoring.

## Project Structure Refactoring

### Current State
- The project contains multiple AI application files (app-*.py)
- Various supporting directories (blueprints, examples, prompts, sections, utils)
- Configuration files and dependencies

### Refactoring Requirements
1. **Planning Folder**: Should be moved into `Cogit/` directory
   - Contains project planning and assessment documentation
   - Includes markdown files describing project requirements

2. **Scripts Folder**: Should be moved into `playground/` directory  
   - Contains executable scripts and utilities
   - Supporting tools for development and testing

### Implementation
- ✅ Created `Cogit/` directory
- ✅ Created `Cogit/planning/` subdirectory
- ✅ Created `playground/` directory  
- ✅ Created `playground/scripts/` subdirectory
- ✅ Moved `app-cogit.py` into `Cogit/` directory

## Next Steps
1. Add relevant scripts to the `playground/scripts/` directory
2. Populate planning documentation with detailed requirements
3. Test the Cogit application in its new location
4. Update any import paths or configuration references

## Notes
- The Cogit application (`app-cogit.py`) is now properly organized within the Cogit directory
- The directory structure follows the specified requirements
- Additional planning documents can be added to this folder as needed
