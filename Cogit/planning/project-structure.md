# Cogit Project Structure

## Refactored Directory Layout

The project has been reorganized according to the assessment requirements:

```
workspace/
├── Cogit/                     # Main Cogit application directory
│   ├── app-cogit.py          # Cogit application entry point
│   └── planning/             # Planning and assessment documents
│       ├── cogit-assessment.md
│       └── project-structure.md
│
├── playground/               # Development and testing area
│   └── scripts/             # Utility scripts
│       ├── setup.py         # Environment setup script
│       └── run-cogit.py     # Cogit application runner
│
└── [other existing directories and files remain unchanged]
```
